How the hell did a generally keg-shaped guy, a hard scientist,
working a dead-end Clerk Typist job, and spending all his spare
time in the consummately nerdy pastime of fantasy role-playing
games, end up in a relationship with a slender and not unattractive
young liberal arts student who spent her spare time sea kayaking
and going to foreign films? It must have been one of those
opposites-attract kind of deals, a complementary relationship.
They met, naturally, in the ILL office, where the highly intelligent
but steady and soothing Randy helped the highly intelligent but
scattered and flighty Charlene organize a messy heap of loan requests.
He should have asked her out then and there, but he was shy.
Second and third opportunities came along when the books she'd requested
began to filter up from the mailroom, and finally he asked her out and
they went to see a film together. Both of them turned out to be not
just willing but eager, and possibly even desperate. Before they knew it,
Randy had given Charlene a key to his apartment, and Charlene had given
Randy the password to her free university computer account,
and everything was just delightful.
